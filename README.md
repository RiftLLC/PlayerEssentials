# HeroicEssentials
Essentials Remake.

A remake of the popular "Essentials" and "EssentialsX" plugins.
Contains more optimized code along with a few other features that neither Essentials or EssentialsX had.
Part of the Levinium Network custom plugins, and it's what allows their server to function like it does.
Has an active developer that updates the plugin regularly and fixes any bugs found within the code or by players on the server.
Plugin can & will most likely be licensed out to other servers if they request it for a few dollars a month.
Contains a Github Whitelisting system so only certain servers can use the plugin.

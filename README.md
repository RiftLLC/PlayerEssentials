Essentials Remake.

This plugin serves as a remake and optimization of the popular Essentials plugin. This works on 1.15.2 only, and is used on the Levinium Network as their core plugin. Licensing this plugin costs $15 a month and you will get full access to all features it has to offer. This plugin has little to no bugs, and if one is found it is patched almost immediately. The network has a group of Beta Testers to test new features on the beta branch. If you would like to license this plugin out to your server, please reach out to Riley on his Discord.

Please Note: This plugin is not fully completeted and more development will be put into the plugin.
